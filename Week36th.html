    <h1>💡 Resolved Exercise: The User Annoyance Deep Dive</h1>
    <p>This exercise shows you how to solve a problem by understanding why someone is frustrated, finding the real reason, and figuring out what they truly need. Use this structure as a template for your own assignments.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. 😠 Identify a User Annoyance (Physical Scenario)</h2>
    <div class="section-box">
        <p><strong>Annoyance:</strong> <span class="annoyance">**Not being able to open a locker easily or quietly, especially when you are in a rush.**</span></p>
        <p><em>Scenario:</em> You are rushing between classes, your hands are full, and you have to wrestle with a sticky lock or a heavy door just to grab a book, making a lot of noise and maybe making you late.</p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. ❓ Create Diagnostic Questions</h2>
    <p><em>Goal: Understand the specific feelings and moments of frustration using **open-ended** questions.</em></p>
    
    <div class="table-container">
        <table>

    <h2>3. 🎯 Identify the Root Cause</h2>
    <div class="section-box">
        <p><strong>Root Cause:</strong> **The physical equipment (lock and hinge) is suffering from poor design, age, or lack of regular maintenance, causing parts to become stiff and misaligned.**</p>
        <p><em>Reasoning:</em> Lockers are often made with cheap materials and rarely checked. The door hinges may be rusty, making them loud and sticky. The lock mechanism might have tiny manufacturing flaws, making the sweet spot for the combination hard to hit consistently. This forces the student to use excessive force and time.</p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. 🛠️ Identify a General Solution</h2>
    <div class="section-box">
        <p><strong>General Solution:</strong> **Implement a Proactive Maintenance and Quality Upgrade Plan.**</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What to Do:</strong> Establish a schedule for regular maintenance where all hinges are oiled, and all locks are tested or replaced annually.</li>
            <li><strong>What to Have:</strong> A system that uses higher-quality, **lightweight lock mechanisms** (like push-button combination locks) and **dampening material** on the inside of the door frame to reduce loud banging noises when closed.</li>
        </ul>
