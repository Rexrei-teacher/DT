                Welcome to your GA3 assessment. The focus of this project is to research, design, and propose a viable solution to a specific problem related to food security in India. This webpage will guide you through the three key components of your submission: developing a solution, creating a design brief, and conducting a peer review.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    In IGCSE Design & Technology, a successful solution is not just a "good idea"; it is a direct response to a clearly identified <strong class="text-blue-600">need</strong>. Your entire project must be driven by this principle.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Identify the Problem & User:</strong> You can't solve "India's food problem"—it's too big. You must narrow it down. Who is your specific user (e.g., a small-hold farmer, a street vendor, a family in a rural village)? What is their *specific* problem (e.g., "30% of tomato harvest spoils before reaching the market due to heat and poor transport")?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Analyse the Needs:</strong> A "need" is the gap between the current problem and the desired outcome.

                            <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Inefficient water use for irrigation during droughts.</li>
                            <li><strong>Need:</strong> A system to deliver water directly to plant roots with minimal waste.</li>

                        <strong>Generate Ideas (Divergent Thinking):</strong> Brainstorm multiple possible solutions that address the specific need. Don't pick your first idea! Think about different approaches (e.g., for cooling: a pot-in-pot cooler, a solar-powered fan, a ventilated storage crate).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Select and Justify (Convergent Thinking):</strong> Evaluate your ideas against the user's needs and constraints (like cost, materials, local skills). Select the *most appropriate* solution and justify *why* it is the best choice for this specific user and problem. Your solution must be a logical and defensible answer to the need.

                    The Design Brief is the most important document in your project. It is a clear statement that defines the problem you are going to solve, who you are solving it for, and the rules (constraints) you must follow. It acts as a "contract" for your design, guiding all your decisions and helping you measure your success.

                        "Small-hold farmers in rural Maharashtra, India, often lose 25-40% of their fruit and vegetable harvest to spoilage before they can sell it at the local market. This is primarily due to high temperatures and a lack of affordable, reliable cold storage, as electricity access is intermittent. A low-cost, non-electric cooling device is needed to extend the shelf life of their produce, allowing them to sell more and increase their income."

                <p class="mb-4">
                    Sketching is how designers think and communicate. In IGCSE D&T, your sketches are not marked on artistic ability, but on their <strong class="text-blue-600">clarity</strong> and <strong class="text-blue-600">ability to communicate your ideas</strong>. You must show your thinking process.

                            <li><strong>Clarity over Beauty:</strong> Use simple lines. A clear, well-labelled diagram is better than a "pretty" but confusing drawing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use 2D and 3D:</strong> Use quick 2D (orthographic) sketches to show dimensions and 3D (isometric, perspective) sketches to show what the product will look like.</li>
                            <li><strong>Show Scale:</strong> Give a sense of size. You can draw a common object (like a hand or a brick) next to your design for scale, or add dimensions.</li>
