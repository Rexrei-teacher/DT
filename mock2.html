            answers: [
                { text: "The study of historical artifacts and their cultural importance.", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. While D&T considers historical context, its main focus is on actively solving current problems, not just studying the past." },
                { text: "The process of identifying real-world problems and creating practical, functional solutions.", correct: true, rationale: "Correct! Design and Technology is all about the cycle of identifying a need and developing a tangible product or system to meet that need." },
                { text: "The creation of art for aesthetic appreciation and emotional expression.", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. While aesthetics are important in D&T, the primary goal is function and problem-solving, which distinguishes it from fine art." }
            ]
        },
        {
            question: "A person is tasked with planning the user experience, functionality, and overall look of a new smart speaker. What is their most likely role?",
            answers: [
                { text: "Artisan", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. An artisan is a skilled craftsperson who makes things by hand. This role is more focused on the high-level planning and conceptualization." },
                { text: "Technologist", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. A technologist would focus on the technical implementation—like the electronics and software—to make the designer's plan work." },
                { text: "Designer", correct: true, rationale: "Correct! The designer is responsible for the 'what' and 'why' of a product, focusing on its function, form, and how the user will interact with it." }

            answers: [
                { text: "A smartphone with the latest camera technology.", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. While a phone can be a need, the 'latest camera' is a specific feature that enhances the product beyond basic necessity, making it a want." },
                { text: "Clean, safe water for drinking and sanitation.", correct: true, rationale: "Correct! This is a fundamental requirement for human survival and well-being, making it a core need that can be solved with technology (e.g., water filters)." },
                { text: "Designer-brand sneakers for social status.", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. Footwear is a need, but 'designer-brand' sneakers are a want, as they fulfill desires for style and status, not just basic foot protection." }

            answers: [
                { text: "Designer", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. The designer would have created the blueprints and decided on the overall concept. This role is about the practical execution." },
                { text: "Technologist", correct: true, rationale: "Correct! The technologist applies technical knowledge and skills to bring the designer's vision to life, focusing on the 'how' of building the product." },
                { text: "Artisan", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. An artisan typically works with traditional crafts. Building complex electronics and systems is the work of a technologist." }

                { text: "A feature or product that is essential for survival.", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. This describes a 'need.' Wants are things we desire but can live without." },
                { text: "A feature or product that improves convenience, aesthetics, or social standing.", correct: true, rationale: "Correct! Wants add value beyond basic function. For example, a car is a want (vs. the need for transport), and a sunroof in that car is another want." },
                { text: "A problem that has no possible technological solution.", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. Wants are often the driving force behind new technologies and product features as companies compete to satisfy consumer desires." }

                { text: "Designer", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. The designer provided the specifications. The woodworker is executing the plan with specialized skills." },
                { text: "Technologist", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. While woodworking is a technology, the term 'artisan' or 'craftsperson' better describes someone skilled in a specific, hands-on trade." },
                { text: "Artisan", correct: true, rationale: "Correct! An artisan is a master of a specific craft, using their hands-on skills to create high-quality objects. This perfectly describes the woodworker." }

            answers: [
                { text: "The desire to travel in a luxury vehicle.", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. Luxury is a want. Public transport focuses on fulfilling the basic need for transportation efficiently and affordably." },
                { text: "The need for accessible and affordable transportation for a community.", correct: true, rationale: "Correct. The core problem being solved is moving people around a city who may not have or want personal vehicles. This is a need for mobility and access." },
                { text: "The want for a fast, private way to get to a destination.", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. Public transport is shared, not private, and while it aims to be efficient, its primary goal is access for all, not maximum speed for an individual." }

            answers: [
                { text: "The ability to hold liquid without leaking.", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. A cup that leaks fails its primary function. Being leak-proof is a fundamental need for any beverage container." },
                { text: "A personalized engraving of the owner's name.", correct: true, rationale: "Correct! The cup functions perfectly without the engraving. This feature adds a personal touch and aesthetic value, making it a clear example of a want." },
                { text: "Being made of a food-safe, non-toxic material.", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. For health and safety, using food-safe materials is a basic requirement and therefore a need for any product designed for consumption." }

            question: "A team is developing a new product. One person focuses on market research and the product's overall purpose, another builds the functional prototype, and a third perfects the final finish. This illustrates...",
            answers: [
                { text: "That only one role is truly necessary for a project.", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. This example clearly shows that multiple roles are required for a successful outcome, each contributing something different." },
                { text: "The collaborative relationship between the Designer, Technologist, and Artisan.", correct: true, rationale: "Correct! This shows the ideal workflow: the Designer (purpose), the Technologist (prototype), and the Artisan (finish) all working together." },
                { text: "That a project's needs and wants are not important.", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. The entire process is driven by understanding and fulfilling the needs and wants of the target user." }

                { text: "The ability to move the cursor on the screen.", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. This is the absolute basic need a mouse must fulfill. If it can't do this, it's not a functional mouse." },
                { text: "An ergonomic shape that prevents hand strain.", correct: false, rationale: "Incorrect. While a very basic mouse might not have it, good ergonomics is a core need for anyone using a mouse for extended periods to ensure health and comfort." },
                { text: "Customizable RGB lighting that syncs with the game.", correct: true, rationale: "Correct! The mouse works perfectly without the lights. This feature is purely for aesthetics and personalization, making it a classic 'want'." }
